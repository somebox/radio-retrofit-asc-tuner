# Radio Controller Refactor - Completion Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
1. **‚úÖ Unified Browse System**
   - Single list containing Presets 1-7 + All Playlists
   - No more "playlist mode" vs "preset mode" confusion
   - Seamless browsing across all stations

2. **‚úÖ Encoder Behavior**
   - Fixed 2-clicks issue (adjusted from 4-step to 2-step detent tracking)
   - CW (right) = Previous, CCW (left) = Next
   - 1 physical click = 1 menu item scroll
   - Smooth, responsive scrolling

3. **‚úÖ Encoder Button = Play/Stop Toggle**
   - Press while browsing: Plays selected item
   - Press while playing: Stops playback
   - Press while stopped: Resumes last station
   - New selections auto-play

4. **‚úÖ Memory Button = Browse Toggle**
   - Tap Memory button: Show/hide browse menu
   - Memory LED lights up while browsing
   - Clean, intuitive menu access

5. **‚úÖ LED Brightness Levels**
   - **Playing station: BRIGHT (255)** - always visible
   - **Selected while browsing: DIM (128)** - if different from playing
   - **Memory button: BRIGHT (255)** - when menu active
   - Clean visual feedback

6. **‚úÖ Browse Timeout**
   - 5 seconds of inactivity
   - Auto-returns to now-playing display
   - Shows current station or metadata

7. **‚úÖ Display Management**
   - **Playing**: Shows scrolling metadata (auto-scroll by RetroText)
   - **Stopped**: Shows static station name
   - **Browsing**: Shows item names
   - Timeout returns to appropriate display state

8. **‚úÖ VU Meter Integration**
   - **Playing**: 80% brightness (204/255)
   - **Stopped**: 10% brightness (26/255)
   - Smooth slew animation

## ‚è≥ Not Yet Implemented

### Future Enhancements
1. **Memory + Preset Hold = Save Station**
   - Requires button hold detection logic
   - Would allow reassigning presets on-the-fly
   - Deferred to future iteration

## Integration Requirements

### ESPHome YAML Changes Needed

The firmware now exposes these methods that need to be called from YAML:

```cpp
// Call from Home Assistant automations
void set_now_playing_metadata(const std::string &metadata);
void set_playback_state(bool playing);
```

### Suggested YAML Updates

Add lambdas to receive metadata and playback state from Home Assistant:

```yaml
text_sensor:
  # Receive metadata from HA
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: ha_metadata
    entity_id: media_player.your_player
    attribute: media_title  # or combine artist + title
    on_value:
      - lambda: |-
          id(controller).set_now_playing_metadata(x);

# Receive playback state
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: ha_playback_state
    entity_id: media_player.your_player
    attribute: state
    on_value:
      - lambda: |-
          bool playing = (x == "playing");
          id(controller).set_playback_state(playing);
```

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Operation
- [x] Encoder scrolls smoothly (1 click = 1 item)
- [x] CW scrolls backward, CCW scrolls forward
- [x] Browse includes all presets + playlists
- [ ] 5-second timeout works
- [ ] Display shows current station after timeout

### Encoder Button
- [ ] Press while browsing ‚Üí Plays selected item
- [ ] Press while playing ‚Üí Stops playback
- [ ] Press while stopped ‚Üí Resumes last station
- [ ] "STOPPED" appears when stopped

### Memory Button
- [ ] Tap Memory ‚Üí Browse menu appears
- [ ] Tap Memory again ‚Üí Menu disappears
- [ ] Memory LED lights up during browse
- [ ] Memory LED off when not browsing

### LED Behavior
- [ ] Playing station always BRIGHT
- [ ] Selected item DIM if different from playing
- [ ] All LEDs off except playing when not browsing
- [ ] LEDs update immediately

### Display
- [ ] Metadata scrolls during playback (if long)
- [ ] Station name static when stopped
- [ ] Browse shows item names
- [ ] Timeout returns to proper display

### Preset Buttons
- [ ] Press preset ‚Üí Starts playing that station
- [ ] LED lights up for active station
- [ ] Display shows station name, then metadata
- [ ] VU meter brightens

## Known Issues / Notes

1. **Media player entity hardcoded** - Currently set to `"media_player.macstudio_local"`, should be made configurable

2. **Old playlist code still present** - The deprecated `playlist_mode_active_` and related code is still in place for backward compatibility during transition. Can be removed once testing confirms new system works.

3. **Preset saving not implemented** - Memory+Preset hold to save current station deferred to future iteration.

## Architecture Changes

### New Data Structures
- `BrowseItem` - Unified structure for presets and playlists
- `browse_items_` - Single vector containing all browseable items
- `browse_index_` - Current selection in browse mode
- `currently_playing_index_` - What's actually playing
- `is_playing_` - Play/stop state
- `now_playing_metadata_` - Latest metadata from HA

### Removed Concepts
- Separate "playlist mode" vs "preset mode"
- Dual state management for browsing
- Complex mode switching logic

### Simplified Flow
1. All items in one list
2. Encoder always browses
3. Encoder button always toggles play/stop
4. Memory button always toggles browse
5. Timeout always returns to now-playing

Much cleaner and more intuitive!

## Performance Notes

- Encoder detent tracking prevents double-counting
- Browse list built once at startup + when playlists load
- LED updates batched per state change
- Display updates only when needed
- No polling loops, all event-driven

## Next Steps

1. **Flash and test** the current implementation
2. **Update YAML** to call `set_now_playing_metadata()` and `set_playback_state()`
3. **Verify** all behaviors match expectations
4. **Fine-tune** timeout duration if needed (currently 5s)
5. **Consider** implementing preset saving feature
6. **Remove** deprecated playlist mode code once stable

## Build Command

```bash
cd /Users/foz/src/radio-retrofit-asc-tuner/esphome
esphome upload devices/radio.yaml
```
